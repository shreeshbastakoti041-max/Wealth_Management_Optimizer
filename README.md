# Stock_Price_predictor
This project develops a quantitative portfolio optimizer using Modern Portfolio Theory. It analyzes historical multi-asset data to estimate risk and return, then computes the allocation that maximizes the Sharpe ratio while generating the efficient frontier to illustrate the risk–return trade-off.This project uses historical Apple (AAPL) data to predict next-day closing prices and test a simple breakout trading strategy.It builds technical indicators like 20-day and 50-day moving averages, identifies breakout signals, and trains a Linear Regression model to forecast prices. Model performance is evaluated using MAE and R².The project also compares a breakout-based strategy against buy-and-hold, visualizing cumulative returns and prediction accuracy to assess performance.
